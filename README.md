constraints on ssn number Generate a social security number generator that when randomized, a function can be called which returns the number. All should be done in a constraint and the function should return the number without further massaging it a representation of the SS #. You need to decide how you want to return it (meaning the data-type or data structure for it).Here are some conditions
//1.There should be no more than 2 consecutive repetitions of a digit in a row. Ex., it can’t be 222–45–2345. (222 is a problem. 2 appearing more than 2 times is okay but not in a row
//2. No more than 3 numbers consecutively. That is, 2345 is not okay, but 234 is okay, 23 is okay.
//3. Number can’t start with zero
